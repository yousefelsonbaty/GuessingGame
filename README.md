# Guessing Game

For this project, JavaFX & Eclipse were used in Windows Programming (CMPE 361) to develop an application that contains two tabs for two different games:
- The first game is titled "Guess The Number", where the user must guess the randomly generated number between 0 and 100. If the player gives up, they can click on a button to reveal the correct answer. If the player reveals or correctly guesses the number, a pop-up window will appear to ask the user if they want to continue or quit the game.
- The second game is called "Math Quiz Game" where the player must enter their username and select the correct answer for the equation ax = b, where a is a number between 0 and 10, and b is a multiple of a. The advanced version is where a is between the range of 11 & 100. The player can also change the font size and theme of the game.
